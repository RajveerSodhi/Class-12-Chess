# Class-12-Chess

I began my programming journey in grade 11 in high school. A few months in after learning my first programming language - Python, I decided to challenge myself and write code for a program much tougher than I am currently capable of, and hence wrote the program for an in-console Chess game.

I then further built upon this game in the 12th grade by creating a separate applicaiton which stores transcripts of games played. 

The program for this chess game is not efficient or clean by any means. Moreover, without any knowledge of OOP, I wrote the entire program in just one file. I aim to create more and more complex Chess programs as I learn more about the field of computer programming moving forward.
